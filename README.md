# Matrix Compression for Machine Learning

This project implements fractal compression and Huffman-based quantization algorithms for matrix compression, adapted to run efficiently on NumPy arrays while maintaining accuracy and achieving high compression ratios.

- **`fractalDemo.py`**  
  Demonstrates fractal compression on sample matrices/images.
- **`huffmanDemo.py`**  
  Demonstrates the quantization + Huffman encoding pipeline.
- **`tests.py`**  
  A suite of unit tests covering both fractal and Huffman modules.
